# CRANberries

This is the bot behind <https://bsky.app/profile/cranberriesfeed.bsky.social>.
It parses the feed of CRAN updates from <http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranberries/about/> and posts a summary once per hour on Bluesky.

It's also meant as a showcase for how to build bots on top of the [{atr}](https://jbgruber.github.io/atr/) package.
